            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>"The author of English by the Nature Method has aimed at providing those who wish to learn English and are denied the help of an ordinary teacher, with a text-book that might, in little over a year, bring them to the point where reading English books and conversations in English may be, or at least begin to be, actually possible. This means that they must be made to acquire an intelligible pronunciation, the essentials of the grammar, a fairly copious vocabulary and plenty of idiomatic phrases. A careful examination of the sixty chapters--each to be mastered in a week--has convinced me that Mr. Jensen has really succeeded in doing all he had set out to do. On reaching the end of the booklet, any student with normal, even if untrained mind, will certainly be capable of reading easy stuff, of understanding something of the spoken language, even of speaking it to some extent".</p>
